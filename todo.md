2) Remove/replace anything that looks placeholder or “not true”

On the homepage you have “0+ miners deployed”, “0% satisfaction”, “0% uptime”, “0+ years” — that kills trust. 
TheLuxMining

Also the copy claims “industry-leading ASIC, best J/TH ratio, uptime guarantee” which sounds like you’re selling large-scale industrial miners (Antminer/WhatsMiner), not boutique acrylic solo miners.

Quick wins

Delete the stat row until you have real numbers.

Replace enterprise claims with your real differentiators:

handmade / premium acrylic

engraving / customization

desk-friendly / conversation piece

small batches / quality control

support + setup guide

3) Homepage structure that fits your actual store (high-converting)

Here’s a front page layout that matches what you sell:

A) Hero (above the fold)

Headline idea:
“Premium Bitcoin Solo Miners & Crypto Desk Gear.”
Sub: “Handmade acrylic builds, cold-storage essentials, and gifts for Bitcoin people.”

Buttons:

Primary: Shop Solo Miners

Secondary: Shop Cold Storage / View Gallery
(Keep “Request Quote” only if you truly do bulk/custom.)

B) Shop by Category (3–4 big tiles)

Solo Miners (Desk Edition)

Cold Storage

Keychains / Gadgets

Accessories / Cables / PSU (if you sell them)

C) Best Sellers (real products)

4–8 product cards:

clear photo

price

“In stock / Ships in X days”

“Customization available”

D) “Why TheLuxMining” (boutique reasons, not ASIC claims)

3–5 bullets like:

Handmade premium acrylic

Laser-engraved personalization

Beginner-friendly setup

Tested before shipping

Fast support

E) Social proof (you already have 1 great review)

Keep it, but also show:

“As seen on” (Etsy/eBay/IG) if applicable

3–6 photo testimonials later

F) Gallery teaser

You already have “View Gallery” — make it a visual strip of 5–8 images.

G) FAQ (reduce support + increase conversion)

“Is this a lottery/solo miner?”

“What do I need to run it?”

“Does it include power supply?”

“Shipping & returns”

“Customization”

4) Trust cleanup (this matters a lot)

Right now your footer/contact details look inconsistent across pages:

Home footer shows diego@theluxvending.com
 
TheLuxMining

Products footer shows contact@theluxmining.com
 and a placeholder phone 
TheLuxMining

Contact page shows luxmining1@gmail.com
 
TheLuxMining

✅ Pick one primary support email + real phone (or remove phone) + real business location (or just “USA / EU shipping” if you prefer privacy). Consistency = conversions.

5) Copy that matches your products (ready to paste)

If you want a quick swap that instantly aligns the brand:

Hero headline:
Where Bitcoin hardware becomes desk art.
Sub: Premium solo miners, cold storage, and crypto lifestyle pieces—built to look as good as they run.

Section title:
Featured Drops (Small Batches)
Sub: Limited builds—when they’re gone, they’re gone.

Why us bullets:

Handmade acrylic builds + premium finish

Custom engraving available

Tested before shipping

Simple setup guides

Friendly support
