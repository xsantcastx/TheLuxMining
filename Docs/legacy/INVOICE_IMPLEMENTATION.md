  - Product name (wrapped if too long)
  - Quantity
  - Unit price (formatted as currency)

## Usage

### From Orders Page
1. Navigate to `/client/orders`
2. Find an order in the list
3. Click "Download Invoice" button
4. PDF will be automatically downloaded as `invoice-{orderNumber}.pdf`

### From Confirmation Page
1. Complete a purchase
2. On confirmation page, click "Download Invoice" button
3. PDF will be automatically downloaded as `invoice-{orderNumber}.pdf`

## Error Handling
- Validates order ID exists
- Checks order data is available
- Graceful error messages for users
- Console logging for debugging
- Fallback handling for missing data fields

## Data Compatibility
The invoice service is designed to work with different order data structures:
- **Orders Page**: Uses `date` property
- **Confirmation Page**: Uses `createdAt` property
- Service handles both formats automatically
- Supports different item property names (qty/quantity, unitPrice/price, etc.)

## Technical Notes

### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
export interface InvoiceOrder {
  id?: string;
  orderNumber: string;
  date?: Date;
  createdAt?: any;
  status: string;
  total: number;
  items: InvoiceOrderItem[];
  shippingAddress?: any;
  // ... other fields
}
```
